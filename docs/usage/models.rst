Models

Schematics models are the next form of structure above types. They are a
collection of types in a class. When a `Type` is given a name inside a `Model`,
it is called a `field`.


.. _simple_model:

Simple Model
============

Let's say we want to build a social network for weather. At its core, we'll
need a way to represent some temperature information and where that temperature
was found.

::

  import datetime
  from schematics.models import Model
  from schematics.types import StringType, DecimalType, DateTimeType

  class WeatherReport(Model):
      city = StringType()
      temperature = DecimalType()
      taken_at = DateTimeType(default=datetime.datetime.now)

That'll do.  Let's try using it.

::

  >>> wr = WeatherReport({'city': 'NYC', 'temperature': 80})
  >>> wr.temperature
  Decimal('80.0')

And remember that ``DateTimeType`` we set a default callable for?

::

  >>> wr.taken_at
  datetime.datetime(2013, 8, 21, 13, 6, 38, 11883)

We can also initialize a model using keyword arguments to its constructor.

::
  >>> wr = WeatherReport(city='NYC', temperature=80)
  >>> wr.temperature
  Decimal('80.0')


.. _model_configuration:

Model Configuration
===================

Models offer a few configuration options.  Options are attached in the form of a
class.

:: 

  class Whatever(Model):
      ...
      class Options:
          option = value

``namespace`` is a namespace identifier that can be used with persistence
layers.

:: 

  class Whatever(Model):
      ...
      class Options:
          namespace = "whatever_bucket"

``roles`` is a dictionary that stores whitelists and blacklists.

::

  class Whatever(Model):
      ...
      class Options:
          roles = {
              'public': whitelist('some', 'fields'),
              'owner': blacklist('some', 'internal', 'stuff'),
          }

``serialize_when_none`` can be ``True`` or ``False``.  It's behavior is
explained here: :ref:`exporting_serialize_when_none`.

::

  class Whatever(Model):
      ...
      class Options:
          serialize_when_none = False


.. _model_mocking:

Model Mocking
=============

Testing typically involves creating lots of fake (but plausible) objects. Good
tests use random values so that multiple tests can run in parallel without
overwriting each other. Great tests exercise many possible valid input values
to make sure the code being tested can deal with various combinations.

Schematics models can help you write great tests by automatically generating
mock objects. Starting with our ``WeatherReport`` model from earlier:

::

  class WeatherReport(Model):
      city = StringType()
      temperature = DecimalType()
      taken_at = DateTimeType(default=datetime.datetime.now)

we can ask Schematic to generate a mock object with reasonable values:

::

  >>> WeatherReport.get_mock_object().to_primitive()
  {'city': u'zLmeEt7OAGOWI', 'temperature': u'8', 'taken_at': '2014-05-06T17:34:56.396280'}

If you've set a constraint on a field that the mock can't satisfy - such as
putting a ``max_length`` on a URL field so that it's too small to hold a
randomly-generated URL - then ``get_mock_object`` will raise a
``MockCreationError`` exception:

::

  from schematics.types import URLType

  class OverlyStrict(Model):
      url = URLType(max_length=11, required=True)

  >>> OverlyStrict.get_mock_object()
  ...
  schematics.exceptions.MockCreationError: url: This field is too short to hold the mock data
