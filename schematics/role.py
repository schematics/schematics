    A ``Role`` object can be used to filter specific fields against a sequence.

    The ``Role`` contains two things: a set of names and a function.
    The function describes how to filter, taking a field name as input and then
    returning ``True`` or ``False`` to indicate that field should or should not
    be skipped.

    A ``Role`` can be operated on as a ``Set`` object representing the fields
    it has an opinion on.  When Roles are combined with other roles, only the
    filtering behavior of the first role is used.
